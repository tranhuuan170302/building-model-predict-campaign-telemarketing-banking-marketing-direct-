# <center>Building and choice data model predict marketing direct </center>
## I. introduction
<p>Telemarketing is one of the powerful means of direct marketing as mobile in marketing direct. There in the field banking, marketing direct brings effective great for business. The most successful telemarketing is based on quality data from customers. By using the data mining technique, we can predict customers' needs.</p> <br>
<p>in this personal project. I analyze and build a model to predict the possibility of deposits of customers. I use algorithm machine learning such as logistic regression, support machine learning, ANN, KNN, and decision tree.</p> <br>
<p>Information dataset: [Documnent](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henriqueyamahata/bank-marketing)</p> <br>
## II.Introduction to run the code:
1. Import library.
2. Summary dataset.
3. Data overview.
4. Find problem.
5. Find relationship between feature to deposit.
6. Reducing redundant data. 
7. Standardized data.
8. Building model.
9. Plot model predict
